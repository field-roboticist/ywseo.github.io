        <h1>Vehicle Actuation Control for Autonomous Driving</h1>

	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	
        <p>What is control? What do you mean by controlling vehicle
        actuation for autonomous driving.</p>

	<h2>2. Vehicle Actuation Control for Autonomous Driving</h2>

	<h3>2.1 Vehicle Models</h3>
	<p>Developing a good controller is to start from modeling
	  vehicle's dynamics and constraints. Having a good model of
	  vehicle enables us to analyze and tune the controller more
	  efficiently. The vehicle model what we're referring to is a
	  mathematical model that describes how the vehicle moves. To
	  describe how a vehicle moves, we can first talk about the
	  kinematic model. The kinematic model is a simplification of
	  vehicle dynamics that typically ignores many important
	  physic elements like gravity, mass, tire forces, etc., but
	  it's relatively simple and performs well in
	  practice. Whereas a dynamic model captures a vehicle's
	  motion in the real-world that incorporates tire foreces,
	  longitudinal and lateral forces, inertia, grativity, air
	  resistance, drag, mass, the geometry of the vehicle, chassis
	  suspension, etc. Note that more realistic models are more
	  complex and more challenging. Thus, in practice, there is
	  always a trade-off to make, depending on the
	  application.</p>

	<h3>2.2 Representation of Vehicle Models</h3>

	<p>It is common to represent the state of a vehicle by a
	  multi-dimensional vector. Specifically, the state of a
	  vehicle can be represented by its position <i>x</i>
	  and <i>y</i>, orientation, velocity. The figure at the below
	  illustrates a kinematic model, aka bicycle model and its
	  differential equation.</p>

	<p>The differential equation tells us how the state is changed
	over time. For an actual implementation, we need to represent
	such a differential equation in a continuous time into a
	discrete one.</p>
