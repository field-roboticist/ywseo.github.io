        <h1>Regulating Vehicle Actuation Commands for Autonomous Driving</h1>

	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	
        <p>Before delving into learning about the topic of vehicle
        control, the very first question we should ask ourselves is
        <i>what does that mean by regulating actuation commands of
        a vehicle and even for autonomous driving?</i> Before throwing an
        answer to this, let's think about, for a moment, how we, as
        human, does driving a car, particularly parts related to
        actuations like steering wheel, acceleration, and
        braking. When we begin to drive, for most of the cases,
        we <i>gently</i>
	  <ul>
	    <li>press accelerator to make car begin to drive,</li>
	    <li>press accelerator and brake in turn while cruising
	      through traffics until reaching a destination,</li>
	    <li>press brake to make car stop driving at the destination.</li>
	  </ul>
	  Unless something appears abruptly on our way of driving,
	  most of us operates our cars gently to get us to where we
	  need to be.</p>
	
	<p>What I just described is an aspect of our daily, manual
	driving that we control/regulate our actuation as we follow a
	virtual path to the destination. The virtual path is a result
	of route planning we do before driving the car and can also be
	an imaginary line we drive our car to follow while driving on
	roads. Let's call, for now, this virtual path as a reference
	trajectory. We drive our cars to overlap our actual trajectory
	close to the reference trajectory as possible as we could. In
	other words, we control the actuators (i.e., steering wheel,
	accelerator, and brake) of our vehicle to follow the reference
	trajectory.</p>

	<p>Having said this, we now have something to answer the
	  question we asked to ourselves earlier.</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>What is it to regulate the actuation commands of a vehicle
	  for autonomous driving?</p></blockquote>
	<p>In a laymen's term, it is to control/regulate the values of
	 the vehicle actuation commands to minimize the difference
	 between the reference trajectory and the actual
	 trajectory. At this point, you might want to ask where does
	 this reference trajectory come from and how does this have to
	 anything with autonomous driving? In a typical architecture
	 or the architecture that I have in mind for a self-driving
	 car, the reference trajectory is typically provided by a
	 vehicle behavior planner or a motion planner. For example,
	 given traffic conditions reported and the current position by
	 a perception stack and the map of area, a behavior planner
	 might switch back and forth different driving modes and based
	 on a driving mode, ``driving down road," for example, a
	 motion planner generates an optimal trajectory for the
	 vehicle to drive to a stopline of the next
	 intersection. Given this trajectory or the reference
	 trajectory, the goal of a controller is to generate a series
	 of the actuation commands that minimize the difference
	 between the reference trajectory and the actual
	 trajectory.</p>

	<h2>2. Vehicle Actuation Control for Autonomous Driving</h2>

	<h3>2.1 Vehicle Models</h3>
	<p>Developing a good controller is to start from modeling
	  vehicle's dynamics and constraints. Having a good model of
	  vehicle enables us to analyze and tune the controller more
	  efficiently. The vehicle model what we're referring to is a
	  mathematical model that describes how the vehicle moves. To
	  describe how a vehicle moves, we can first talk about the
	  kinematic model. The kinematic model is a simplification of
	  vehicle dynamics that typically ignores many important
	  physic elements like gravity, mass, tire forces, etc., but
	  it's relatively simple and performs well in
	  practice. Whereas a dynamic model captures a vehicle's
	  motion in the real-world that incorporates tire foreces,
	  longitudinal and lateral forces, inertia, grativity, air
	  resistance, drag, mass, the geometry of the vehicle, chassis
	  suspension, etc. Note that more realistic models are more
	  complex and more challenging, but not necessarily guarantee
	  a better performance. Thus, in practice, there is always a
	  trade-off to make, depending on the application.</p>

	<h3>2.2 Representation of Vehicle Models</h3>

	<p>The state of a vehicle typically represents its
	  position <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, orientation <i>theta</i>,
	  velocity <i>v</i>. The following figure illustrates a
	  kinematic model (aka bicycle model) and its differential
	  equation. The differential equation tells us how the state
	  is changed over time.</p>

	<img src="/vehicle-control/fig/kinematic-bicycle-model.png" />

	<p>where <b>u</b> is a control input for an actuation command
	that consists of <i>a</i> for acceleration both positive and
	negative and <i>phi</i> for steering angle. A ground vehicle
	typically has three actuators: steering wheel, throttle and
	break pedals. For the simplicity, one variable is used to
	represent two of those actuators, throttle and break pedals,
	together and change the values of throttle and break pedals
	together as in + for throttle and - for break pedals. </p>

	<p> For an actual implementation, we need to represent
	such a differential equation in a continuous time into a
	  discrete one.</p>

	<img src="/vehicle-control/fig/bicycle-discrete-form.png"/>

	<p>where omega is the heading rate of change or angular rate
	  and defined as v/L tan(phi(t)) and v is updated by v = v + a*dt.</p>

	<h3>2.3 Controllers as Error Minimizing Algorithms</h3>
	<p>In a
	typical <a href="http://www.fieldrobotics.org/users/alonzo/pubs/papers/JFR_08_Boss.pdf">architecture</a>
	of self-driving car, a behavior planner sets the goal of a
	vehicle (e.g., drive through a lane and stop at the stop line
	of an intersection). Given a motion goal, map, vehicle
	location, information about other neighboring objects, a
	motion planner generates a trajectory. Given this reference
	trajectory, a controller regulates the outputs of actuators to
	  follow the trajectory.</p>

	<p>How does a controller actually do this -- regulating the
	outputs of the actuators to follow the reference trajectory?
	It does that by minimizing the area between the reference
	trajectory and the vehicle's actual driving
	path. Specifically, one can minimize this error by predicting
	the vehicle's path and then adjusting the control inputs to
	minimize the difference between the prediction and the
	reference trajectory. This is where one can use a kinematic
	model to predict the vehicle's future state. Once you've
	predicted the error you can actuate with the vehicle to
	  minimize the error over time.</p>

	<p>Thus the goal of developing a vehicle controller is to
	develop a controller that minimizes the distance between the
	predicted position of a vehicle and the corresponding position
	at the reference trajectory. This error between a predicted
	location and the corresponding location at the reference
	trajectory is called the <b>cross track error</b> (CTE). We
	also want to minimize the difference between the predicted
	heading/yaw and the actual one at the reference trajectory. We
	call this the <b>heading/yaw error</b>. Note that the speed is
	not something we want to minimize. If we do, we would end up
	minimizing the speed below zero and driving in reverse,
	possibly.</p>

	<h3>2.4 Errors to Minimize</h3>

	<p>Let's look at how the errors we are interested in change
	  over time by deriving our kinematic model around these
	  errors as our new state vector, [x,y,ψ,v,cte,eψ]. Let’s
	  assume the vehicle is traveling down a straight road and the
	  longitudinal direction is the same as the x-axis -- the body
	  frame of which the z axis is up.</p>

	<p>The CTE for this example is then error/difference between
	the center of the road and the vehicle's position. The CTE of
	the successor state after time t is the state at t+1, and is
	defined as: cte_{t+1} = cte_{t} + vt∗sin(eψ_{t})∗dt, where
	cte_{t} can be expressed as the difference between the line
	and the current vehicle position y. Assuming the reference
	line is a 1st order polynomial f, f(x_{t}) is our reference
	line and our CTE at the current state is defined as:
	cte_{t}=y_{t}−f(x_{t}).</p>

	<p>If we substitute cte_{t} in the original equation with the
	above definition, cte_{t+1} = y_{t} −
	f(x_{t})+(v_{t}∗sin(eψ_{t})∗dt). This helps us to brake the
	  cte_{t+1} into two parts:
	  <ul>
	    <li>y_{t} − f(x_{t}) being current cross track error.</li>
	    <li>v_{t}∗sin(eψ_{t})∗dt being the change in error caused
	      by the vehicle's movement.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>Now let’s take a look at the orientation error:
	eψ_{t+1}=eψ_{t}+(vt/Lf)∗δt∗dt. The update rule is essentially
	the same as ψ. eψ_{t} is the desired orientation subtracted
	from the current orientation eψ_{t}=ψ_{t}−ψ_{des_{t}}. We
	already know ψ_{t}, because it’s part of our state, but we
	don’t yet know ψ_{des_{t}} (desired psi) - all we have so far
	is a polynomial to follow. ψ_{des_{t}} can be calculated as
	the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_angle">tangential
	angle</a> of the polynomial f evaluated at x_{t},
	arctan(f'(x_t)). f′ is the derivative of the
	polynomial. eψ_{t+1}= ψ_{t} −
	ψ_{dest}+(vt/Lf∗δt∗dt). Similarly to the cross track error the
	orientation error, eψ_{t+1} can be broken down in to two
	  parts:
	  <ul>
	    <li>ψ_{t} − ψ_{des_{t}} being current orientation error.</li>
	    <li>vt/Lf∗δt∗dt being the change in error caused by the
	      vehicle's movement.</li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>

	<h2>3. Proportional, Integral, Derivative (PID) Control </h2>
	<p>We just reviewed what control of vehicle actuations is
	roughly about. Now let's take a look at one of the well-known
	control algorithms: PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative)
	control. For the vehicle actuation control, what it is meant
	by developing a PID controller is to tune three gains so that
	the output of a PID controller minizes the error like CTE or
	  heading.</p>

	<img src="/vehicle-control/fig/PID_en.svg" /> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">Source</a>
	
	<p>The PID controller is a type of the closed-loop, feedback
	controller. Specifically, given a setpoint/reference value, a
	controller produces its output as a weighted sum of the P,I,D
	gains and corresponding error terms, and compares the
	measured, output value to the reference value, in order to
	produce its outputs close to the reference value. The goal of
	the controller is to eliminate the error or difference between
	its output and the reference value. Thus, a design of a PID
	  controller typically involves in 
	  <ol>
	    <li> defining each of three error terms and</li>
	    <li> finding the optimal values for the P,I,D gains that
	      influences the controller's outputs.</li>
	  </ol>
	</p>

	An implementation of the PID in C++ looks like:
	<pre class="brush: c++">
double kp = 0.1;
double ki = 0.0001;
double kd = 1.0;
	  
void PID::UpdateError(double cte) {
  // integrate the error
  sum_cte += cte;

  // proportional term
  p_error_ = - kp * cte;

  // integral term
  i_error_ = - ki * sum_cte;

  // derivative term
  d_error_ = - kd * (cte - prev_cte);

  prev_cte = cte;
}

double PID::GetPIDOutput() {
  return (p_error_ + i_error_ + d_error_);
}</pre>
	<p>where the UpdateError() function defines three errors,
	"proportional", "integral", and "derivative" in a discrete
	way, and the "GetPIDOutput()" generates a weighted sum of
	three error terms, which, for example, can be the control's
	output for the steering wheel value. In other words, given a
	reference value, a controller generates an output by executing
	"TotalError()". The system computes the difference between a
	controller's output and the reference value, cte.</p>

	<p>Now let's take a look at each of the gain terms of a PID
	controller in details.</p>

	<h3>3.1 Proportional Term</h3>
	<p>The proportional term is a multiplicative scale factor to
	the error (e.g., CTE) where is the difference between the
	reference value and the control output. The controller's
	output, e.g., steering angle, is generated by output = Kp x
	e_{P} where "Kp" is the proportional gain (or scaling factor)
	that can be positive and negative and "e_{P}" is the cross
	  track error (at the current car location).</p>

	<p>The role the proportional term plays is to adjust the
	control output in proportion to the cross track error -- the
	bigger (or smaller) the error the larger (or smaller) the
	control output is. Because of this multiplicative nature, the
	smaller the proportional gain, the smaller the steady state
	error. And the larger the proportional gain, the more likely
	the loop is to become unstable. Thus, the proportional term,
	if it is used alone, would eventually make the controller
	overshoot, leading to oscillation.</p>

	<h3>3.2 Derivative Term</h3>
	<p>To correct such a potential overshooting by a P-controller
	while ensuring the controller to minimize the error, one could
	introduce two more error terms: the derivative, "D" and/or the
	integral term, "I." The derivative term models the error
	rate. It is more like an estimate of the upcoming error based
	on its current rate of the error change. For the case where
	one want to control the car to drive on the centerline of the
	road, assuming the reference trajectory is set along the
	centerline of the road, the cross track error rate captures
	how fast the car is driving in the perpendicular/lateral
	direction. If the car perfectly follows the reference
	trajectory, this rate would be zero. By adding this derivative
	term, the controller's output becomes, steering angle = Kp x
	e_{P} + Kd x e_{D}, where "e_{D}" is the derivative error and
	"Kd" is the derivative gain. In a discretization form, the
	cross track error rate can be approximated by "e_{D}(t) =
	(cte(t) - cte(t-1)) / dt" where "t" is the current
	discretization time, "t-1" is the previous time, and "dt" is
	how much time elapses between two consecutive measurements.</p>

	<p>Now we have two gain factors to find their optimal values,
	in order to eliminate the difference between the reference
	value and the control's output. If we increase "P" to make the
	car close to the reference trajectory, the controller will
	eventually overshoot. To prevent this from happening, we could
	increase the derivative gain to increase the resistance of
	speeding to close to the reference trajectory. Note that in
	general the low "D" gain makes the controller "underdamped" to
	make a car be oscillated whereas the high "D" gain makes the
	controller "overdamped" resulting in a slow convergence. A
	  good "D" gain will make the controller "critically damped."</p>

	<h3>3.3 Integral Term</h3>
	<p>Often, these two error terms are not good enough to
	generate a desirable control output because there are other
	sources of errors: environmental factors, mechanical defects,
	etc. These factors will change the nominal behavior of a
	vehicle, thus the performance of the controller. Suppose that
	the a PD controller manages the cross track error close to
	zero. While driving on the reference trajectory, the car
	drives over the piles of rocks. This event would make the car
	off from driving on the reference trajectory. The zero
	steering angle commands would be no longer keep the car on the
	reference trajectory.</p>

	<p>So the "integral" term, I, is introduced to accumulate the
	cross track error over time in order to check how much time
	the car spends which side of the track. Like other gains, the
	gain of the integral term has a side effect: with a low I gain
	it will take a long time for the controller to generate a
	desirable value. Whereas a high I gain will make the
	controller fluctuate. steering angle = Kp x e_{P} + Kd x e_{D}
	  + Ki x e_{I}.

	</p>

	<p>In summary, the proportional term corrects instances of
	error, the integral term corrects the accumulation of error,
	and the derivative term corrects the error based on the change
	error rate.</p>
