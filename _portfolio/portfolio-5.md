This study aims at developing a method that predicts the CPU usage patterns of software tasks running on a self-driving car. To ensure safety of such dynamic systems, the worst-case-based CPU utilization analysis has been used; however, the nature of dynamically changing driving contexts requires more flexible approach for an efficient computing resource management. To better understand the dynamic CPU usage patterns, this paper presents an effort of designing a feature vector to represent the information of driving environments and of predicting, using regression methods, the selected tasksâ€™ CPU usage patterns given specific driving contexts. Experiments with real-world vehicle data show a promising result and validate the usefulness of the proposed method. Read the following papers to learn more about this work:

 In the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, fully-autonomous ground vehicles will conduct simulated military supply missions in a mock urban area. Robotic vehicles will attempt to complete a 60-mile course through traffic in less than six hours, operating solely under their own computer-based control. To succeed, vehicles must obey traffic laws while safely merging into moving traffic, navigating traffic circles, negotiating busy intersections, and avoiding obstacles.
