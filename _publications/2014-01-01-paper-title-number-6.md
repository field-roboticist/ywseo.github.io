For urban driving, knowledge of ego-vehicle’s
position is a critical piece of information that enables ad-
vanced driver-assistance systems or self-driving cars to execute
safety-related, autonomous driving maneuvers. This is because,
without knowing the current location, it is very hard to
autonomously execute any driving maneuvers for the future.
The existing solutions for localization rely on a combination
of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), an inertial mea-
surement unit, and a digital map. However, on urban driving
environments, due to poor satellite geometry and disruption
of radio signal reception, their longitudinal and lateral errors
are too significant to be used to guide an autonomous system.
To enhance the existing system’s localization capability, this
work presents an effort of developing a vision-based lateral
localization algorithm. The algorithm aims at reliably counting,
with or without observations of lane-markings, the number
road-lanes and identifying the index of the road-lane on the
roadway that our vehicle happens to be driving on. Testings the
proposed algorithms against inter-city and inter-state highway
videos showed promising results in terms of counting the
number of road-lanes and the indices of the current road-lanes.
