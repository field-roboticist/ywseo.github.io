For urban driving, knowledge of ego-vehicle’s position is a critical piece of information that
enables advanced driver-assistance systems or self-driving cars to execute safety-related, au-
tonomous driving maneuvers. This is because, without knowing the current location, it is
very hard to autonomously execute any driving maneuvers for the future. The existing solu-
tions for localization rely on a combination of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),
an inertial measurement unit, and a digital map. However, on urban driving environments,
due to poor satellite geometry and disruption of radio signal reception, their longitudinal
and lateral errors are too significant to be used for an autonomous system. To enhance
the existing system’s localization capability, this work presents an effort of developing a
vision-based lateral localization algorithm. The algorithm aims at reliably counting, with or
without observations of lane-markings, the number road-lanes and identifying the index of
the road-lane on the roadway that our vehicle happens to be driving on. Testings the pro-
posed algorithms against inter-city and inter-state highway videos showed promising results
in terms of counting the number of road-lanes and the indices of the current road-lanes.
