For safe urban driving, one prerequisite is to keep
a car within a road-lane boundary. This requires human and
robotic drivers to recognize the boundary of a road-lane and
the location of the vehicle with respect to the boundary of
a road-lane that the vehicle happens to be driving in. We
present a new computer vision system that analyzes a stream
of perspective images to produce information about a vehicle’s
lateral movements, such as distances from a vehicle to a roadlane’s
boundary and detection of lane-changing maneuvers.
We improve existing work in this field and develop new
algorithms to tackle more challenging cases, such as driving on
inter-city highways. Tests on real inter-city highways showed
that our system provides stable and reliable performance in
terms of computing lateral distances, while yielding reasonable
performance in detecting lane-changing maneuvers.
