In advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous
driving vehicles, many computer vision applications
rely on knowing the location of the vanishing point on a
horizon. The horizontal vanishing point’s location provides
important information about driving environments, such as the
instantaneous driving direction of roadway, sampling regions of
the drivable regions’ image features, and the search direction
of moving objects. To detect the vanishing point, many existing
methods work frame-by-frame. Their outputs may look
desirable in that frame. Over a series of frames, however,
the detected locations are inconsistent, yielding unreliable
information about roadway structure. This paper presents a
novel algorithm that, using the extracted line segments, detects
vanishing points in urban scenes and tracks, using Extended
Kalman Filter, them over frames to smooth out the trajectory
of the horizontal vanishing point. The study demonstrates both
the practicality of the detection method and the effectiveness
of our tracking method, through experiments carried out using
hundreds of urban scene images.
