This paper presents a computer vision algorithm
that detects, by analyzing lane-marking detection results, stop-
lines and tracks, using an unscented Kalman filter, the detected
stop-line over time. To detect lateral and longitudinal lane-
markings, our method applies a spatial filter emphasizing the
intensity contrast between lane-marking pixels and their neigh-
boring pixels. We then examine the detected lane-markings to
identify perpendicular, geometry layouts between longitudinal
and lateral lane-markings for stop-line detection. To provide re-
liable stop-line recognition, we developed an unscented Kalman
filter to track the detected stop-line over frames. Through the
testings with real-world, busy urban street videos, our method
demonstrated promising results, in terms of the accuracy of the
initial detection accuracy and the reliability of the tracking.
