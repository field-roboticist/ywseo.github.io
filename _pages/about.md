I'm Youngwoo Seo. For the past 17 years, I was fortunate enough to work with many bright and hardworking people, sharks and wolves as well, and have gained expertise on developing cutting-edge, robotic systems (e.g., self-driving cars, drones, a new high-speed transportation, etc.) through the combination of hands-on experience and in-depth understanding of robotics. By training I'm a field roboticist and computer scientist. By vocation I'm a seasoned manager with managing diverse groups. By nature I guess I'm an explorer.
